# Black Jack 

The game I decided to make is black Jack.
It's gonna function like a standard black jack game but I am adding a twist to what the user is betting with.
I'm doing this game because I couldn't decide on what type of game I wanted to make.  

Honestly Not many things was inspiring me until I saw Teo's examples. When he showed us the black jack game I immediatily thought I can do something like that but anime theme. That's when I decided to make a black jack game based around the idea of an anime I'm currently watching called ONE PIECE. 

The game at its core is a standard black jack card playing game. I've added my own little twist to it, normally the user/you would be betting with chips or actual money. But since my game is anime theme the user the will be betting 150 years of their human lifespan. The computer who will be playing as one of the Emperors named BIG MOM who has a devil fruit ability to mess with a person soul and shorten their lifespan. 

I'm hoping to use my game to get people interested in giving the show a shot.

Hope you enjoy, I will be working on adding a next round button to add more playability along side some more features but I still haven't decided upon on which ones.
